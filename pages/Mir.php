            <p> Wide-angle lens Mir 1B in a tube! Produced at VOMZ in 1990. Fastening - thread M42. The optical scheme is borrowed from the German company Carl Zeiss (Jena DDR) - the name Flektogon. The lens is made of metal and glass with a minimum of plastic parts. This speaks of its reliability and durability. The focusing ring with distance markings in meters rotates quite easily, the rotation angle is about 270 degrees. The lens produces a fairly sharp soft image and also produces beautiful bokeh. On the crop it acts as a good portrait lens, on the full matrix it allows you to make cool landscapes. Mir-1V 2.8 / 37 is an excellent specimen that can cope with various photo tasks.</p>
